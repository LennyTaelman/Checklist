# SorryDB Agent development checklist

This is an artificial lean 4 project containing a number of sorried statements.
It intends to help with the development of SorryDB agents. 

The sorries in this project are *easy* from the point of view of automated
theorem proving, but represent individual engineering issues that may occur when
attempting to automatically fill sorries 'in the wild'.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you encounter (recurring) engineering issues that
may occur in automatically tring to fill sorries, feel free to make a PR.

Requirements:

1. Only `Prop`-valued sorries without metavariables (holes)
2. Please submit minimal working examples, so that each sorry representes a
   unique difficulty
3. Please don't include the proof in the code, but do provide the proof string
   in the PR description

## Types of sorries

### Placement of the sorry keyword


### Context and premise selection
